Project Name: Library Management System

Description:
This system allows library staff and students to perform various tasks related to book management, including adding books, borrowing, returning, and viewing borrowed books. It provides functionalities for both administrative tasks (handled by staff) and user operations (handled by students).

Key Features:
Role-based User Access:

Staff Role:
Add new books to the library.
View the list of borrowed and returned books.
Student Role:
View all available books in the library.
Search for books by ISBN.
Borrow books (if available).
Return books.
Book Management:

Books are stored with details like title, category, ISBN, and quantity.
Staff can add new books to the library.
The system tracks the number of available copies of each book.
Book Borrowing and Returning:

Students can borrow books if they are available, which decreases the available quantity.
Books can be returned by students, increasing the available quantity.
File-based Data Storage:

Books are stored in a text file (books.txt).
Borrowed and returned books are recorded in separate text files (borrow-book.txt and return-book.txt).
Each operation (borrow/return) is timestamped and stored with the studentâ€™s name.
Search Functionality:

Students can search for books by ISBN to view detailed information about a specific book.
Simple UI:

The system interacts with users via the console, with clear prompts for both staff and students.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
File Handling: BufferedReader and BufferedWriter for reading and writing to text files
Data Storage: Text files for storing book, borrow, and return records
Target Users:
Staff: Library administrators responsible for managing books and overseeing the borrowing/returning process.
Students: Library users who can borrow and return books, and search for books by ISBN.
Potential Enhancements:
Integration with a database for more robust data management.
User authentication for staff and students.
A graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user experience.
This project could be used by any library to automate and streamline its book borrowing and returning system, making it easier to manage books and track their availability.
